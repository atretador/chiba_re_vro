		<t id="32">The Chiba E is the Terran refinement of the Pioneers' original converted design. In a rare display of technological acknowledgement, the Terran Protectorate purchased access to the Chiba's design specifications and soon placed an improved version into service. While the design heritage of the Hokkaido hull remains clearly evident, the Chiba E is built to purpose from the keel up; featuring numerous internal modifications and improvements including expanded fighter-handling facilities and dedicated launch tubes, the ship has greatly improved performance in the light carrier role. \n\nIdentical in function to the original, the Chiba E is commonly seen patrolling Terran space, serving as a a base for local policing efforts or as small task force leaders.</t>
