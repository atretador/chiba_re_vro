Files are unpacked - I've just extracted the Chiba E related files from the [x4-Reemergence Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/1166?tab=files)

Non-VRO version can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/1159?tab=description)


I've made a few changes to the stats:
Fighter storage increased from 12 to 18
Drone Capacity decreased from 23 to 18
ï»¿Crew capacity increased to 44
Missile capacity decreased to 40
Made slightly faster


The RE version rebalances the original VRO Chiba to have less fighters like the Guppy, but the guppy is such a massive tank compared to the Chiba that I felt like it required a few more fighters.
